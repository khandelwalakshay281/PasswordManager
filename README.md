# PasswordManager
PassOP is a secure and user-friendly password manager built using React, MongoDB, and Postman. It allows users to store, manage, and retrieve their passwords efficiently. Features include password validation, a visually appealing UI, and robust error handling.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

How to start the project
1.) In the Pass OP folder install all the node modules using npm i
2.) Run: npm run dev 
3.) In the backend folder install all the node modules using npm i
4.) Run: node --watch server.js
